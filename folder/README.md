## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- 
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to create a React App using VITE, which makes the downloading process faster. This is also my first hosted React project. I have been learning React but not practicing it much.
I was actually planning on making one single card component but used two(card info, and card image) to get more practice with import components and such.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

My App component... looks simple. XD
```JSX
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Image />
      <Info />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue to learn and build more React Projects like this. In the future I would like to learn TailWind and even before that SCSS and SASS so I can get better at writing CSS.
I didn't use grid in this but I'm currently learning it and would like to apply and learn it more in the future.
